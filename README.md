# Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project involves the development of a **Sales Analysis Dashboard** using Power BI to explore key metrics and trends related to product sales and order volumes. The dashboard offers valuable insights into sales performance, product demand, and time-based ordering patterns to aid decision-making and strategy development for businesses.

## Project Overview

The Sales Analysis Dashboard provides visualizations that help answer the following questions:
- What are the total sales and order volumes over a specific period?
- How do sales and order quantities vary by product?
- How does sales performance vary month-by-month?
- What are the busiest times for order placement?

## Key Insights

### 1. **Total Sales and Orders:**
   - The dashboard covers **3984 orders** with total sales reaching **$781.38K** within the selected period (January 1, 2019, to April 30, 2019).
  
### 2. **Sales by Month:**
   - The sales peaked in **March** with **$202K**, followed by a slight decline in April and January with **$191K** and **$187K**, respectively.
  
### 3. **Number of Orders by Month:**
   - **February** had the highest number of orders with **1078 orders**, followed by **March** (981 orders), **January** (970 orders), and **April** (955 orders).

### 4. **Sales by Product:**
   - The **Macbook Pro Laptop** generated the highest revenue at **$184K**, followed by the **iPhone** at **$117K**. Other top-selling products include **Google Phone** and **ThinkPad Laptop** with sales of **$88K** and **$86K**, respectively.

### 5. **Order Quantity vs Sales:**
   - A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between sales amount and the number of items sold, indicating the variation in sales based on quantity ordered.

### 6. **Order Volume by Time:**
   - The "Number of Orders by Time" chart reveals the distribution of orders across different times of the day, with activity peaking around the late morning and remaining steady throughout the day.
